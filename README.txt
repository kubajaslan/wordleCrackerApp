The app should be launched with a live server (such as is available in VScode for example).

The grid represents the Wordle puzzle. By clicking a single box the colour changes so that we can exclude or include
the letters in the final answer.

White = excldue completely
Green = Include at that position
Yellow = include but at a different position.

The list of words below represents the possible answers that are left after including and excludeing letters.
